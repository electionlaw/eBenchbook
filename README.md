# Election Law eBenchbook

[Assisting courts adjudicating election matters](https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2015/election-law-program-launches-ebenchbook-project.php). A project of the Election Law Program, William & Mary Law School / National Center for State Courts.

## Introduction

We aim to create a state-by-state breakdown of election codes, organized by topic, case law, and annotation, which balances analysis by law students with reviews and curated discussion from state election experts including election administrators, scholars, and attorneys from the two major parties.

Working under the supervision of Professor Rebecca Green and Project Manager Austin Graham, law students will produce a set of annotated state election codes for Virginia, Florida, and Colorado. Students will concentrate efforts on surveying a set of nine election law topics in each state, and will incorporate prior in-state and out-of-state litigation into their analyses. Committees of experts from each state will review the materials created and direct students to revise and edit where necessary to present accurate reflections of current law. After the baseline materials are created, the state committee members will engage in a collaborative effort to hash out differing interpretations of election rules in their state. State committee members will also suggest web-based and off-line materials to be incorporated into the database for reference. The result of the foregoing activities will be compiled into a single, easy-to-use, interactive web platform that will allow judges an opportunity to compare and understand state election codes, in isolation or as a part of Americaâ€™s larger election legislation landscape. The project will be completed in time for the 2016 U.S. primaries. The project begins with the three aforementioned states of Virginia, Florida, and Colorado; our intention is that all fifty states be added using the prototype we build.

## Goals

If successful, this project will create a single forum of carefully-crafted interpretations of state election codes. The benefits to be reaped from such a project are many:

* Assisting members of the judiciary in achieving just outcomes in election cases
* Identifying gaps in state election codes
* Reducing election litigation costs 
* Increasing public awareness and understanding of state election codes 
* Assuring a more robust democratic process through community dialogue
* Fostering of greater public trust of the election system and the judiciary 
* Increasing legitimacy of election outcomes

## Installation

The project is in the planning stages, and not yet available for installation.
