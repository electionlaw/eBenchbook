# Project Roadmap

# Planning

* Determine whether the fundamental unit of the data is a law (which may include multiple legal concepts, or only include part of a larger legal concept, or a discrete legal concept (which may include multiple laws, or just part of one law).
* Schedule the project sprints.

# Development

* Rough in the site, adding custom fields and displaying them in a theme.
* ELP tests adding a handful of records to the system, to see how well the structure matches the data.
* Iterate.

# Acceptance Testing

* Work with a small number of judges (3–5) throughout the development process, to see if the project is meeting their needs.
* Have one major round of acceptance testing with a larger number of judges (10–20), with a structured feedback process.
