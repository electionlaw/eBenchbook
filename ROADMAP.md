# Project Roadmap

## Planning

* [Determine whether the fundamental unit of the data is a law](https://github.com/electionlaw/eBenchbook/issues/18) (which may include multiple legal concepts, or only include part of a larger legal concept, or a discrete legal concept (which may include multiple laws, or just part of one law).
* [Put together a couple of user stories](https://github.com/electionlaw/eBenchbook/issues/8) to help to understand how to best serve judges' needs.
* [Select an open source license under which to publish the software](https://github.com/electionlaw/eBenchbook/issues/2), which presumably ELP will need to do in consultation with the William & Mary Office of University Counsel and the National Center for State Courts.
* [Identify every discrete unit of data that needs to be stored](https://github.com/electionlaw/eBenchbook/issues/11).
* Schedule the project sprints.

## Development

* Set up WordPress on a staging server, [deploying it from GitHub](https://github.com/electionlaw/eBenchbook/issues/20).
* Rough in the site, [adding custom fields](https://github.com/electionlaw/eBenchbook/issues/21) and [displaying them in a theme](https://github.com/electionlaw/eBenchbook/issues/22).
* ELP tests adding a handful of records to the system, to see how well the structure matches the data, and how well the data entry and editorial process matches how they want/need to work.
* Iterate.
* Document the deployment process.
* Deploy the site to ELP's server.
* [ELP enters all laws, legal guidance, etc](https://github.com/electionlaw/eBenchbook/issues/23).

## Acceptance Testing

* Work with a small number of judges (3–5) throughout the development process, to see if the project is meeting their needs.
* Have one major round of acceptance testing with a larger number of judges (10–20), with a structured feedback process.
